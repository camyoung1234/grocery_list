# grocery_list
A simple offline grocery list app with two custom user defined sorting modes to make reviewing the list at home and shopping in the store both easier.

## Features
This app is designed as a static site that can be opened in a web browser. It is not a mobile app. It is a web app.

### Sorting Modes
The app has a toggle between two sorting modes:
1. Store
2. Home

### Store Mode
In store mode, the list is sorted by aisle. The aisles are defined by the user in the settings.

### Home Mode
In home mode, the list is sorted by category. The categories are defined by the user in the settings.

### Settings
The settings allow the user to define the aisles and categories for the store mode and home mode.

### Notes
All data is stored in the browser's local storage. The app works offline as a progressive web app.
